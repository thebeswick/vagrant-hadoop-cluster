======================
Updating to get it to work with VMware Fusion and Vagrant 1.3.x

Deploying hadoop in a virtualized cluster in simple steps

These are the files that support the blogpost http://cscarioni.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/setting-up-hadoop-virtual-cluster-with.html

For using them.

Simply clone the repository, then

`gem install vagrant `

`vagrant box add base-hadoop http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid64.box`


Maybe generate your own ssh-keygen pair of keys.. and replace them in the files id_rsa and id_rsa.pub in the modules/hadoop/files directory


`vagrant up`

then 

`vagrant ssh master`

`cd /opt/hadoop-xxx/bin`

`./hadoop namenode -format`

`./start-all`
